/**
  Returns the next instance of the matched GUID HOB from the starting HOB.

  This function searches the first instance of a HOB from the starting HOB pointer.
  Such HOB should satisfy two conditions:
  its HOB type is EFI_HOB_TYPE_GUID_EXTENSION and its GUID Name equals to the input Guid.
  If there does not exist such HOB from the starting HOB pointer, it will return NULL.
  Caller is required to apply GET_GUID_HOB_DATA () and GET_GUID_HOB_DATA_SIZE ()
  to extract the data section and its size info respectively.
  In contrast with macro GET_NEXT_HOB(), this function does not skip the starting HOB pointer
  unconditionally: it returns HobStart back if HobStart itself meets the requirement;
  caller is required to use GET_NEXT_HOB() if it wishes to skip current HobStart.

  If Guid is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If HobStart is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  Guid          The GUID to match with in the HOB list.
  @param  HobStart      A pointer to a Guid.

  @return The next instance of the matched GUID HOB from the starting HOB.
